These are some thoughts on what I need to do still.  Order does not indicate
priority.

* Write test scripts for everything.  Until then you just have to use them as
they were intended to see if they work.  In many cases, you could run the
"Synopsis" programs and compare their output to what I have in the POD.

* Write makefiles for everything.  Meanwhile, you'll have to copy the
old-fashioned way.

* Fix bug in HTML::FormMaker where providing a Hash ref as a "labels" parameter
for radio/field groups doesn't work (acts like explicit labels not provided and
uses values as labels).  In the meantime, using an Array ref for that parameter
works fine, so I suggest using it instead.

* Make a utility program that utilizes HTML::FormMaker's abilities to let users
create form definitions for it with a web browser.

* Flesh out POD in HTML::FormMaker so that users don't need to reference CGI.pm
to know what various field types and their normal parameters are for (they are
sideways compatible).  The parameters I added are explained, however.

* Complete POD in CGI::WebUserInput; it is missing Synopsis, Description, and
method descriptions (although their names and params are listed).

* Test cookie-handling abilities of CGI::WebUserInput.

* Explicitely add cookie-storing-handling abilities to CGI::WebUserOutput. 
Meanwhile, you can use http_header() to get a reference to the internal
HTTP::Headers object and give it your cookies directly.
