	* Release 0.91.
	
	* The module CGI::EventCountFile has been combined into this distribution 
	rather than being its own distribution, "EventCountFile".  During the move it
	received updates and went from 1.01 to 1.02; details are below.
	
	* All 7 modules in this release are now functionally synchronized in respect 
	to the methods new(), initialize(), and clone().  Modules that lacked any of 
	these had them added, and the others received rewrites.  Exceptions are that 
	HTML::TagMaker and HTML::FormMaker don't have initialize() methods, and the 
	clone() method in CGI::HashOfArrays can take extra arguments relative to the 
	others' clone() methods.  Related to these updates, all of the modules 
	should be easier to subclass than they were before, particular if they are 
	one of multiple parents.
	
	* All modules in this release have had their version numbers incremented by 
	0.01, and they now read like this:
		HTML::TagMaker 1.01
		HTML::FormMaker 1.01
		CGI::HashOfArrays 1.02
		CGI::WebUserInput 0.91
		CGI::WebUserOutput 0.91
		CGI::SequentialFile 1.01
		CGI::EventCountFile 1.02

	* Updated HTML::FormMaker to remove a few cases of intimate knowledge it 
	had of HTML::TagMaker, which is inappropriate to good class design.

	* Added two new methods to CGI::HashOfArrays which allow it to read from or 
	write to open filehandles.  The new method to_file() will url-encode the 
	HoA object and write it to the file, whereas from_file() will read an 
	url-encoded object from a file and add its keys and values to the HoA.  
	Likewise, new() and initialize() have been updated to accept filehandles.

	* Updated the implementation of CGI::SequentialFile so that it requires the 
	new functionality of CGI::HashOfArrays; the module's public interface and 
	behaviour has not changed as a result, however.

	* Updated CGI::WebUserOutput so that when redirect_url() has a value, the 
	HTTP headers that this module generates have a "status" value of "301 Moved" 
	instead of "302 Found" as before.  Hopefully, this change should incite more 
	appropriate behaviour in search engines that index your sites.

	* Updated CGI::WebUserInput to change the way it deals with instances where 
	you want to make several CGI::WebUserInput objects rather than the usual of 
	one.  Due to the fact that this class reads POST data from standard input 
	when making a brand new object, and that this action can only be done once 
	in the life of the program, and that this class does not employ global 
	variables, you need to use an existing object when instantiating another so 
	that this data can be available to both.  In this new version of the class, 
	you need to use the first object's clone() method to produce the second, 
	and then optionally call initialize() on the second.  In the old version 
	there was no clone method and you said "$two = $one->new()" to accomplish 
	the same thing.  This will no longer work in the newer new(), and in fact 
	you risk hanging your program to call new() more than once since it would 
	likely block on a read from standard in that isn't there.  This change to 
	new() was made because subclasses of CGI::WebUserInput previously would 
	need intimate knowledge of the class in order to not break the function.

	* Release 0.9.

	* This release contains the following modules, which were previously among 
	the low-level components of my "libdwg" distribution, but I have set these 
	off on their own for those of you who only want to use them and not the 
	higher-level components.  There are also mid-level components here:
		HTML::TagMaker 1.0
		HTML::FormMaker 1.0
		CGI::HashOfArrays 1.01
		CGI::SequentialFile 1.0
		CGI::WebUserInput 0.9
		CGI::WebUserOutput 0.9

	* These modules contain complete POD within them, except for 
	CGI::WebUserInput.  It does have Name, Requirements, Syntax, and lists of 
	methods and "preferences".  It is lacking Synopsis, Description, and 
	descriptions for the methods and prefs.
	
	* These modules requires Perl version 5.004.
	
	* The following distributions are needed by this one.  Some in all 
	circumstances and some optionally depending on how your web site is 
	configured.  Only directly-referenced modules are considered.  Other 
	distributions that these call in turn are not listed:
		- Class-ParamParser-1.0.tar.gz
		- libwww-perl-5.48.tar.gz

	* Additionally, on 2000-08-27, the distribution "EventCountFile" was also 
	spun off of "libdwg" and contained only the module CGI::EventCountFile 1.01.
	That distribution ceased to exist on 2000-11-14 when CGI::EventCountFile was 
	moved into the "CGI-FormGenerator 0.91" distribution.

	* libdwg 1.11, the last version of the distribution to include the above 
	7 modules, was released.
	
2000-07-23   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* libdwg 1.0, the first version of any distribution to include the above 
	7 modules, was released on CPAN.

2000-05-15   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Completed primary development on these modules' code, but the POD is mostly
non-existant.

2000-01-28   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Began development on the final versions of these modules.
	
	* All modules based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

1999-07 thru 1999-12

	* Created and developed most of the code that ended up in these modules.
	Most of these modules were meant to replace and extend the functionality 
	that I previously found in CGI.pm when the latter became inadequate to my 
	needs, and they are also largely backwards-compatible with it.  The 
	exceptions are CGI::SequentialFile, which was started previously, and 
	CGI::EventCountFile, which was updated from a previous production version.

1999-02 thru 1999-05

	* Created first prototypes of some code that ended up in these modules and 
	used them to generate my web sites for a year.  The code in question is 
	mostly relevant to CGI::SequentialFile and CGI::EventCountFile,	and CGI.pm 
	handled most of what other functionality CGI-FormGenerator now replaces.
