	* Release 0.9.

	* This release contains the following modules, which were previously among 
	the low-level components of my "libdwg" distribution, but I have set these 
	off on their own for those of you who only want to use them and not the 
	higher-level components.  There are also mid-level components here:
		HTML::TagMaker 1.0
		HTML::FormMaker 1.0
		CGI::HashOfArrays 1.01
		CGI::SequentialFile 1.0
		CGI::WebUserInput 0.9
		CGI::WebUserOutput 0.9

	* These modules contain complete POD within them, except for 
	CGI::WebUserInput.  It does have Name, Requirements, Syntax, and lists of 
	methods and "preferences".  It is lacking Synopsis, Description, and 
	descriptions for the methods and prefs.
	
	* These modules requires Perl version 5.004.
	
	* The following distributions are needed by this one.  Some in all 
	circumstances and some optionally depending on how your web site is 
	configured.  Only directly-referenced modules are considered.  Other 
	distributions that these call in turn are not listed:
		- Class-ParamParser-1.0.tar.gz
		- libwww-perl-5.48.tar.gz

	* Completed primary development on these modules' code, but the POD is mostly
non-existant.

2000-01-28   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Began development on the final versions of these modules.
	
	* All modules based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

1999-07 thru 1999-12

	* Created and developed most of the code that ended up in these modules.
	Most of these modules were meant to replace and extend the functionality 
	that I previously found in CGI.pm when the latter became inadequate to my 
	needs, and they are also largely backwards-compatible with it.  The 
	exception is CGI::SequentialFile which was started previously.

1999-02 thru 1999-05

	* Created first prototypes of some code that ended up in these modules and 
	used them to generate my web sites for a year.  The code in question is 
	mostly relevant to CGI::SequentialFile, and CGI.pm handled most of what 
	other functionality CGI-FormGenerator now replaces.
